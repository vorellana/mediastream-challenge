# Mediastream challenge

## Development considerations

* Completed all 4 challenges.
* Challenges 1 and 2 were time tested and different shapes and libraries were tested and the most optimal ones were chosen.
* For challenge 3, with React, it was implemented in several reusable components and unit tests were added.
* The dependency level issues with mongoose and EsLint for React have been found and resolved.

## Requisites

* [Node.js 14.x](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) running.

## Considerations

* You can use any IDE of your preference.
* You can use any library you want, unless it's declared otherwise in a challenge. But remember we want to test your abilities to solve problems in the best and simplest possible way.
